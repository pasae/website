                                    Say hello to our third intern of the week, Joseph Casey! Joseph is a first year from
                                    Chula Vista, California and is a declared Architecture major, though he is still
                                    exploring other fields, particularly the life sciences. What drew Joseph to Cal was
                                    the incredible flexibility the school offers when it comes to exploring different
                                    areas of study. Whereas other schools he gravitated towards attending--mainly Cal
                                    Poly SLO--were more strict with changing majors, he appreciated how Cal would have
                                    allowed him to explore multiple options. Joseph also found our campus’ diverse
                                    student population more comfortable, an environment he grew accustomed to in high
                                    school. Joseph also told us how Senior Weekend played a significant role in choosing
                                    to attend Cal. To this day, he is still close friends with those he met at Senior
                                    Weekend.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When Joseph isn’t studying for midterms, he enjoys going on late-night runs to
                                    Durant Food Court or listening to nostalgic childhood music videos like Big Time
                                    Rush because he believes that college should be fun! He also said he likes to, “try
                                    new things,” but when asked to specify, he declined to further comment. ;p Joseph
                                    also likes hanging out in his room with his floormates. As one of the only rooms
                                    with an open-door policy, he says his room became a, “quad converted to a lounge,”
                                    and it’s not uncommon for others to come in to hang out or study. Additionally,
                                    Joseph works for the Daily Cal as a layout designer. He says that he helped out with
                                    designing his high school’s newspaper, which is what drew him to working with the
                                    Daily Cal. Joseph also says working in journalism is what initially motivated him to
                                    pursue design and architecture.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When asked whether Cal is living up to his expectations, Joseph thought everyone
                                    here would be snakes! However, he says that the reality of it is that there are a
                                    lot of really nice people and it just matters who you choose to surround yourself
                                    with. For him, a big part of that has been PASAE and the community it fosters. He
                                    really likes PASAE and believes the work PASAE does is meaningful. He values the
                                    professional development and mentoring the organization provides. As an intern for
                                    Keziah, he says he’s benefited from the resources and guidance she has given him,
                                    including photography and editing skills.
                                </p>

                                    Joseph says that the best about coming to Cal is how independent he has become. Now
                                    that he no longer has his parents to watch over him, he’s learned to be more
                                    self-sufficient and how to manage his time better. However, Joseph is still learning
                                    to be independent. He’s been sick twice now and normally when he’s sick, his lola or
                                    mom would make him soup or calamansi juice. Now that he doesn’t have that, he says
                                    he’s definitely learning to take care of himself!

                                    Our very first intern of the week is Audrey Aniag! She is currently a second year
                                    here at Cal. Although she was initially a Chemical Engineering major, she plans to
                                    switch into Material Science Engineering. She first liked Chemical Engineering, but
                                    after taking her first introduction class in MSE, she instantly fell in love with it
                                    and is having a great time in her MSE classes! Audrey is from San Diego, California
                                    (“858, yo!”) She is specifically from Mira Mesa, the filipino town of San Diego. Her
                                    home is actually only a short walk away from Seafood City. When making her deciding
                                    on where to go to college, she wanted to go to experience a new environment,
                                    differing from where she grew up. She already decided to attend Cal based on the
                                    prestigious programs here, but when she attended bridges’ Senior Weekend under PASS
                                    (The Pilipinx Academic Student Services), it only confirmed her desire to attend
                                    Cal.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    During Senior Weekend, her Ates (mentors) were Danielle Carino, Jilian Cabornay, and
                                    Hopey Balatan! It was through her Senior Weekend Ates where she was influenced to
                                    look into and join PASAE! When she first joined PASAE for their first event, she was
                                    immediately attracted to their vibrant personalities. She really enjoyed everyone’s
                                    caring and warm personalities, and how inclusive they all were to new members. She
                                    stayed in PASAE, because she gets a sense of community in PASAE. During her first
                                    year at Cal, she was feeling pretty homesick and was isolating herself in a
                                    beginning. However, after warming up with people in PASAE, she started hanging out
                                    with her fellow peers and started feeling closer to them, creating a strong bond
                                    with each and everyone of them. Her favorite part of PASAE is that she is able to
                                    ask advice from upperclassmen about anything whether it’s about classes, academics,
                                    or just life in general. She enjoys everyone in PASAE! Her favorite memory from her
                                    time in PASAE is watching Travis doing the worm (Ask Travis to sample).
                                    During her free time, she likes to spend a lot of time with Camille, her Senior
                                    Weekend sib, as well as with her friends in PASAE. She also loves to sing (no sample
                                    though 😔) and likes to watch HGTV in her spare time. She likes watching Fixer Upper
                                    and Property Brothers.

                                    During times when school seems to be too much for her, she looks to her mom for
                                    motivation. Growing up, she felt like she wasn’t as close to her as she is now.
                                    However, now that she is away from home, she feels like she can open up to her more
                                    and her mom reciprocates the same feeling. Learning about the struggles her mom went
                                    through, it only encourages Audrey to be successful in school. During her past year
                                    in Berkeley, she has learned to love and accept herself for who she is. In high
                                    school, she felt like she was constantly comparing herself to other people but after
                                    being around very strong, confident people in college (Keziah, Andrew, Dani), she
                                    felt like she has learned of her own worth and learned that it is useless to compare
                                    oneself to other people. She feels like she can now confidently say that she
                                    genuinely loves herself and who she is.

                                    We have our second intern of the week, Conner Manuel! Conner is a first year
                                    International Student intending to study Data Science and Media Studies. He was born
                                    and raised in the Province of Laguna, Philippines. Originally, he had no intention
                                    of applying to school outside of the Philippines. However, after going to academic
                                    boot camps, he wanted to see how he would compare outside. After doing further
                                    research, his desire to study abroad grew, and he added universities in the west
                                    coast and east coast of the United States to the list of schools he applied to.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When asked about activities outside of PASAE, Conner talks about going to the gym,
                                    finding new places to eat, and hanging out with friends. While here in the Bay Area,
                                    he hopes to try out different restaurants instead of his regular meal at Crossroads.
                                    Conner also has a creative side to him. He likes taking/editing pictures as well as
                                    has some graphic design experience. When asked about the music he listens to, he
                                    talked about how he liked listening to current OPM! Conner also listens to
                                    Brockhampton and Frank Ocean. When asked about sports, he said that back in high
                                    school, he used to play center in his high school basketball team, so if you’re in
                                    need of a center (we’re looking at you, PBA), Conner is just the man for you!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Conner is a new member of the PASAE’dkicks and has been enjoying his time in PASAE.
                                    He is currently interning under the CS Representative (Travis Reyes). Through
                                    Travis, he hopes to learn more about networking and coding. Although PASAE might be
                                    known as a professional organization, Conner values the friendships and mentors he
                                    has gained. It’s organizations like these (PASAE, PAA, etc.) that has helped Conner
                                    transition into college life while being far away from home. He hopes to make more
                                    friends here (although, he seems to be very popular when we were walking down on
                                    Telegraph), and is excited for what is to come. He would also like to say, “xD Rawr
                                    uwu”
                                </p>

                                    Our first intern highlight of the Fall 2018 is Nikka Sandoval! She is a third year
                                    studying Genetics and Plant Biology. She doesn’t know what she wants to do in the
                                    future, but she really enjoys chemistry/biology. Growing up, Nikka moved around a
                                    lot, so she has a few hometowns: Hagata, Guam; Manila, Philippines; and San
                                    Francisco, California!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    She joined PASAE because she wanted to be around fun/great/inspiring/like-minded
                                    people and is currently a Social Chair intern. Outside of PASAE, she is also PASS’s
                                    External Relations Coordinator! She enjoys getting food with friends, traveling with
                                    her family, listening to music, making spotify playlists, and watching Brooklyn
                                    nine-nine/friends/criminal minds. When Nikka was a first year in college, she
                                    randomly sat next to Jo Apellanes (PASAE's current Historian) at a PASS info session
                                    and they became friends! A few weeks later they talked about their hometowns and
                                    found out that they lived in Guam at the same time, and that over a decade ago, they
                                    were in the same kindergarten class together at St. John’s School (Go Knights!) in
                                    Tamuning, Guam and were friends as kids!

                                    Our first intern highlight of the spring semester is Ferdie Taruc! He is a fourth
                                    year majoring in Economics and Data Science. Ferdie’s originally from Saipan and
                                    moved to California when he was seven years old. He joined PASAE mainly because he
                                    wanted to intern under the Historian! Some of Ferdie’s hobbies and interests include
                                    fashion, thrifting, going to music concerts/festivals, making playlists for people,
                                    and watching anime/tv shows. His favorite shows include Mr. Robot, Master of None,
                                    and Atlanta. Ferdie’s also trying to read a book per month this year and get into
                                    running, so he can hopefully run a marathon later in the year! After college, Ferdie
                                    wants to get a Master’s degree in Data Science or Statistics and get a data science
                                    or analyst role in tech or finance. However, later in life he’s trying to move to a
                                    rural area in Japan and start his own bakery (message him you know how to make good
                                    bread)!

                                    currently a second year majoring in cognitive science and minoring in computer
                                    science. Fun facts: she loves Shawshank Redemption and cinnamon buns and is also
                                    allergic to Dayquil! Her favorite story to share from freshman year is when during
                                    her first week at Berkeley, she unconsciously followed someone all the way to BAMPFA
                                    even though she was trying to go back to her dorm! She decided to go to Berkeley
                                    because of the prestige and financial aid it offered her. Jezel decided to join
                                    PASAE after hearing about it at Senior Weekend and to find a support group for STEM
                                    majors.

                                    City majoring in Bioengineering! After undergraduate she wants to go straight into
                                    the biotech industry for project management and operations, then go to graduate
                                    school. She joined PASAE because she wanted to stay involved with the Filipino
                                    Community, since she came from a city with a large Filipino population. She is proud
                                    of her heritage and wants to continue to support other Filipino youth by being part
                                    of PASAE. Outside of PASAE she has been elected as the Corporate Committee Chair of
                                    the UC Berkeley Engineering Society, and will be interning at Potrero Medical this
                                    summer! She can play the alto and tenor saxophone and, recently, she began playing
                                    the acoustic guitar. Star Wars is her favorite movie series, she loves petting dogs,
                                    going to concerts, and wants to eventually take up salsa dancing! Once, Romy made a
                                    post on UC Berkeley’s meme page and she ended up getting over 2000 likes!

                                    Our first intern highlight of Fall 2017 is Devin Balcorta! He is currently a third
                                    year Sociology major from Palmdale, California and a public relations intern for
                                    PASAE. He personally chose Berkeley over schools as it was his dream school since he
                                    was a kid. His favorite movie is Rent the Musical and if he could be any other major
                                    he’d do something with U.S. government. When Devin was a kid he and his family were
                                    gonna visit the Philippines. They were flying out of LAX, but he got lost. All of
                                    LAX international section was shut down so they could find him. He joined PASAE, so
                                    he could connect with an engineering community and because Jo is in it. Much love to
                                    Devin! Look out sometime next week for our next intern highlight!

                                    Our PASAE intern highlight for late October 2017 is Justine Robin Puerto! He’s from
                                    Lancaster, California and is a bioengineering major. He likes to dye his hair as a
                                    form of expression and his favorite movie is a Thai movie called “Crazy Little Thing
                                    Called Love.” His favorite stories to tell are the time he went to karaoke with his
                                    paamily (woo Wavy Paam!!) and the small yet meaningful moments he shares with loved
                                    ones. Justine chose to go to UC Berkeley because of its prestige and excellent
                                    engineering program. However, another key factor in his decision was Senior Weekend.
                                    There, he experienced first-hand the love and support from the Pil Community here at
                                    Berkeley. He later joined PASAE to follow in the footsteps of his Senior Weekend Ate
                                    Corrina and to find a support system here at Berkeley. He says that the people he
                                    has met in PASAE have given him a lot of unconditional love and support -
                                    emotionally, academically, and professionally. Besides PASAE, Justin is also a
                                    current member of BMES (Biomedical Engineering Society).
