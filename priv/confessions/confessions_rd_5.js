"Manifesto of the People's Pa'socialist Party A PA'SPECTRE IS HAUNTING PASAE â€” the pa'spectre of PA'SOCIALISM. All the Pil orgs of UC Berkeley have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this pa'spectre: PAA and PAHC, PBA and Maganda, LFS and P4.Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as pa'socialistic by its opponents in power? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of pa'socialistic, against the more advanced opposition orgs, as well as against its reactionary adversaries ? Two things result from this fact: I.PA'SOCIALISM is already acknowledged by all Pil orgs to be itself a power.  II. It is high time that PA'SOCIALISTS should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Pa'Spectre of PA'SOCIALISM with a manifesto of the party itself.To this end, PASOCIALISTS of various Pil orgs have assembled in Main Pa'Stacks and pa'sketched the following manifesto, to be published in English and a new language, the Pa'Second Tongue.
