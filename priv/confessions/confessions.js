    "Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Alabaster de Boy? I thought not. It’s not a story that Core would tell you. It’s a PASAE legend. Darth Alabaster was a Dank Lord of the Simp, so powerful and so wise he could use the Intercore to influence the pas'aedkicks to create confessions… He had such a knowledge of the dank side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from simping. The dank side of the Intercore is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice wormed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from simp, but not himself.",
