    "To All DeBoys I Loved Before: A Confessions Story /   It was just another Thursday. You were about to head home after a long day of classes and studying when your phone buzzed. It's "Wilson" in the PASAE'dkicks chat. "CONFESSIONS ARE OUT, " the message said. You never really were too keen on confessions; the idea of an anonymous confessions board full of people you knew always seemed like a bad idea. However, after a long day, a bit of entertainment couldn't hurt, and so you decide to sate your curiosity. You'd expect as much from the page, horny confessions and crude jokes. But something catches your eye. A confession on the longer side. Amidst the crowd of text was a confession with your name written all over it. With such passion, someone declared their appreciation, their fascination, their love...for you... You're left wondering who it could've been. Who in PASAE have you seen in the past week? You'd be furious but not surprised if it ended up being one of your friends, as a joke. But the idea of its genuineness lingers in your mind. The idea of anyone thinking of you so tenderly...it makes your heart flutter. And so you think of this mystery writer, professing their affection on the PASAE website of all places. You hate how moved you are, and you wanted to ask around in the group chat, but you don't want to bring attention to yourself, especially if it ends up being a troll. So you're left to wonder... unless... you grab your phone and log on to pasae.berkeley.edu. With shaking hands, you write, "guysss who's confessing about me fr 🥺." Though you didn't believe you'd ever get an answer, there was a sense of satisfaction in having your thoughts out there...free of repercussions, just floating through the net. "I'm beginning to understand the appeal of confessions," you think. You think little of the confession you wrote out. But it only takes a week for it to come back to you. A little past midnight your phone buzzes again. A message, but this time...  it's from DeBoy Alabaster.",
