Since then, I've been trying to get to know you better by sending you stupid TikToks or asking you random, out of the questions. Not only do I think you're cute, I also love how confident you are and you make me smile or laugh whenever I get the chance to talk to you. Like I said, I'm still working on my shyness, so I have trouble telling you this directly, even if it's as simple as sending you a text. And it might be pretty childish to do this on a fucking confessions page, bug fuck it? LOL. Anyway, whoever I'm talking to, if they're reading this, they'll know lol.<br><br><br>- JR",
